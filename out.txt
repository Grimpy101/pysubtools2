{80}{136}Forever.
{120}{250}To the Butcher!
{409}{466}Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?
{532}{568}Go on. Go!
{980}{1070}Is there anyone in the Five Points|you haven't fucked?
{1034}{1052}Yes!
{1062}{1072}You!
{1346}{1392}Belt down!
{1666}{1720}Try it and I'll bite ya.
{1723}{1778}You were gonna bite me.
{1776}{1830}I dont think you want me.
{1802}{1854}Find out.
{2628}{2662}Oh, Jenny!
{3722}{3772}I can't sleep.
{3911}{4098}I hope you don't mind us|laying here, sir?
{4029}{4138}Whatever takes your fancy,|young friend.
{4356}{4432}Is your shoulder keeping you up?
{4414}{4504}I don't sleep too much.
{4494}{4618}I sleep with one eye open. I only|got one eye.
{4706}{4784}How old are you Amsterdam?
{4888}{5072}Not too sure. Never did|figure it.
{5024}{5114}I'm 47.
{5122}{5186}47 years old.
{5268}{5436}You know how I stayed alive|this long? All these years.
{5418}{5458}Fear!
{5504}{5610}The spectacle of fearsome acts.
{5606}{5746}Somebody steals from me, I cut|off his hands.
{5676}{5816}He offends me, I cut out his tongue.
{5760}{5970}He rises against me, I cut off his|head, stick it on a pike!
{5896}{6044}Raise it high up, so all in the|streets can see.
{6022}{6122}That's what preserves the order|of things.
{6186}{6220}Fear.
{6292}{6436}That one tonight. Who was he?
{6426}{6608}A nobody. A coward.
{6588}{6734}What an end that|would have been.
{6706}{6873}I killed the last honourable man|15 years ago.
{6831}{6880}Since then....
{6936}{7008}You've seen his portrait downstairs?
{7092}{7172}Has your mouth been glued up with juice?
{7131}{7198}I asked you a question!
{7164}{7236}I said I've seen it, sir.
{7350}{7486}You got a murderous rage in you.|I like it.
{7431}{7581}So much life boiling up in you.|That's good!
{7614}{7773}The priest and me lived by the|same principles.
{7773}{7876}Only faith divided us.
{7909}{7981}He gave me this you know?
{8090}{8200}That was the finest beating I|ever took.
{8184}{8408}My face was pulp. My guts pierced.|My ribs all messed up.
{8424}{8504}When he came to finish me...
{8590}{8668}...I couldn't look him in the eye.
{8798}{8874}He spared me because...
{8874}{8964}....he wanted me to live in shame.
{8920}{8988}This was a great man.
{9040}{9092}A great man.
{9162}{9264}So I cut out the eye that|looked away.
{9306}{9404}Sent it to him wrapped in|blue paper.
{9392}{9514}I would've cut them both out if I|could afford being blind.
{9522}{9622}I rose up again with a full heart...
{9600}{9694}...and buried him in his own blood.
{9888}{9920}Well done!
{10004}{10126}He was the only man I killed|worth remembering.
{10370}{10442}I never had a son.
{10628}{10722}Civilisation is crumbling.
{11136}{11188}God bless you!
{11928}{12000}If you've got anything to say...
{12010}{12082}...now is the time to say it.
{12084}{12140}Who is he to you, Jenny?
{12282}{12352}I was 12 years old.
{12350}{12474}My mother was dead. I was living|in a doorway.
{12494}{12802}He took me in. Took care of me in|his own way.
{12792}{12872}After they cut out the baby...
{12922}{13041}He doesn't fancy girls that|scarred up.
{13168}{13330}You should know, in your own mind...
{13306}{13450}...that he never laid a hand on me|till I asked him too.
{13941}{14002}Who are you?
{14018}{14086}Who are you?
{15916}{16262}Gentlemen, you are most welcome to|this palace of enchantment...
{16102}{16498}...with visions to rival the tales of|Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!
{16880}{16978}Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!
{16944}{17068}Feast you eyes on the magnificent blue...
{17034}{17098}...of these creatures.
{17082}{17236}Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!
{17176}{17302}How would you like to make them sing?
{17252}{17496}They could be singing for you.
{17546}{17720}May God put the spirit of the|holy steel in my spine...
{17666}{17804}...and the love of the blessed|Virgin in my heart.
{17818}{17860}Amen.
{17954}{18104}Easy now. What did you say?
{18050}{18134}He's not who he says he is.
{18138}{18212}He's not who he says he is?
{18292}{18398}Count you blessings he considers|you a friend!
{18398}{18598}The only thing he considers every day|and night is how to kill you!
{18566}{18690}Those eyes want me to take|them out for you!
{18668}{18776}I'll bury it up you fundunem where|it belongs!
{18740}{18852}I can read right through them!|They're empty...
{18796}{18846}His name is Vallon.
{18888}{18940}Don't do it Bill!
{18928}{18978}His name is Vallon!
{19742}{19838}Curious people these celestials.
{19842}{19918}You know why they use short|sleeves?
{19894}{19992}So everyone can see he's got|nothing stashed.
{19958}{20052}I hope it doesn't become a fashion.
{20184}{20208}Johnny?
{21122}{21154}Get up!
{21524}{21766}Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have|your kind attention.
{21644}{21760}As some of you have surely|noticed...
{21714}{21890}...our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting...
{21812}{22094}..is tonight wearing a waistcoat|of certain distinction!
{22068}{22238}May we appeal to him, to favour us...
{22154}{22270}...with another exciting exhibition.
{22224}{22520}Of skill. Courage. Daring and drama!
{22854}{22896}What's gonna happen?
{23566}{23620}The spider's kiss!
{23680}{23726}The wheel of death!
{23718}{23768}William Tell!
{23756}{23782}The butterfly!
{23804}{23848}The spider's kiss!
{23840}{23914}The Butcher's apprentice!
{23896}{23948}The Butcher's apprentice!
{23928}{24036}A command performance!
{24036}{24080}Where have you been?
{24066}{24174}A command performance indeed.
{24132}{24178}I want you to get out of here!
{24170}{24320}And for this, I must beg the|indulgence...
{24244}{24288}...of my former...
{24266}{24376}... assistent in matters of impailment...
{24352}{24462}...the Butcher's original apprentice.
{24454}{24512}What do you say, Jen?
{24492}{24600}One more time for the|sweet souvenir.
{24580}{24602}Come on!
{24846}{24914}Don't do it!
{25180}{25232}She'll be alright.
{25296}{25338}Remember this?
{25322}{25344}Of course!
{25580}{25768}You may feel more comfortable without|that garment, Miss Everdeane!
{25727}{25824}You'll have to filch me a|new one, Bill!
{26124}{26218}Anything in your pockets tonight?
{26188}{26277}I ain't started working yet.
{26320}{26424}What about that locket I| gave you?
{26756}{26868}Apologies my dear. Pick it up.
{26950}{27020}Whoopsie daisy!
{27048}{27122}Now its good and broke!
{27124}{27224}I can't seem to get anything|right tonight.
{27372}{27510}You got the sand to give 'm a|grand finale?
{27664}{27768}Maybe when you're aiming a|little straighter.
{27976}{28052}Enough of this heathen music.
{28038}{28132}Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
{28089}{28133}Strike up boys!
{28152}{28280}This is a night for Americans!
{28420}{28444}Jenny!
{29798}{29844}Hats off!
{30000}{30188}We hold in our hearts the memory|of our fallen brothers...
{30122}{30236}...whose blood stains the very streets...
{30180}{30242}...we walk today.
{30250}{30500}Also on this night, we pay tribute|to the leader of our enemies.
{30426}{30508}An honourable man...
{30492}{30682}...who crossed over bravely.|Fighting for what he believed in.
{30764}{30944}To defeat my enemy, I extinguish|his life...
{30876}{31004}... and consume him as I consume|these flames.
{31004}{31094}In honour of Priest Vallon.
{31108}{31154}In honour of Priest Vallon!
{31262}{31333}That's a wound !
{31532}{31706}I want you all to meet the son of|Priest Vallon.
{31648}{31730}I took him under my wing...
{31716}{31792}...and see how I'm repaid.
{31772}{31910}He saved my life one day so he|could kill me the next...
{31839}{31910}...like a sneak thief.
{31886}{31960}Instead of fighting like a man.
{31968}{32156}A base defiler. Unworthy of|a noble name.
{32386}{32477}That'll do Mcgloin.|Spread him out.
{32489}{32652}I hate blackies. You..you get to watch.
{32732}{32806}This is fresh meat!
{32830}{32928}We need to tenderise this meat|a bit.
{32914}{33066}Alright, lets kiss goodnight to|that pretty face of yours!
{33252}{33300}No.......!
{33332}{33532}What'll it be then. Rib or chop.|Loin or shank.
{33432}{33454}The liver!
{33442}{33466}The spleen!
{33486}{33512}The kidney!
{33670}{33694}The lung!
{33690}{33716}The liver!
{33726}{33748}The tongue!
{33796}{33862}The heart! The heart!
{33830}{33886}The heart?
{33866}{33942}This boy has no heart.
{33904}{34022}Then kill him!
{34094}{34174}He ain't earned the death!
{34144}{34256}He ain't earned the death of|my hands!
{34248}{34390}He'll walk amongst you marked|with shame.
{34318}{34544}A freak. Worthy of Barnum's|museum of wonders.
{34456}{34632}God's only man, speared by|the Butcher.
{35488}{35632}Here. Here. This way.
{35560}{35600}Come on.
{36704}{36780}I want to show you something.
{36884}{36970}My mother's bones share this|grave.
{37000}{37144}I've saved 20 cents out of every|dollar I've ever earned since ....
{37072}{37122}...I was thirteen.
{37166}{37248}That's 215 dollars.
{37236}{37316}For bludgeoning and the rest.
{37394}{37508}This is what I wanted to show you.
{37498}{37626}This is where we're going to go,|as soon as you get better....
{37574}{37744}...San Fransisco, California.
{37724}{37816}You can have anything you want|out there.
{37812}{37964}These men are pulling gold right|out of the river.
{37900}{37956}With their own hands.
{37984}{38156}We're here and need to get there.
{38118}{38170}Start here.
{38170}{38296}Go down 'round here.
{38302}{38364}Up to San Francisco.
{38400}{38460}The shortest way to go.
{38474}{38530}Will you go with me?
{39118}{39246}No need to fire that, miss.|Or even aim it.
{39222}{39332}An audience with yor mangled|friend is all I want.
{39684}{39762}I've 44 notches on my club.
{39776}{39836}Do you know what they are for?
{39876}{39962}To remind me of what I owe God|when I die.
{40114}{40200}My father was killed in battle too.
{40198}{40282}In Ireland, in the streets.
{40312}{40404}Fighting those who were taking|their privilege.
{40378}{40452}What only could be got and held...
{40416}{40502}...by the decimation of a race.
{40500}{40606}That war is a thousand years old|and more.
{40600}{40684}We never expected it to follow|us here.
{40712}{40742}It didn't.
{40764}{40836}It was waiting for us when|we landed.
{40916}{41072}Your father tried to carve out a|corner in this country for his tribe.
{41066}{41142}That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.
{41204}{41312}I often wondered, if he'd lived a|bit longer...
{41310}{41392}...would he have wanted it to|be more.
{41644}{41748}Why did you rifle through his|pockets then?
{42134}{42194}For safekeeping.
{42264}{42326}I thought maybe you could do|with it.
{42848}{42928}Blood stays on the blade.
{44748}{44836}That's a sorry looking pelt.
{44912}{45066}And it's been so nice and quiet|for the last three months.
{45060}{45204}Tell me, this charge. Does it sit|on easy with you?
{45176}{45392}No. Not uneasy , Bill.
{45324}{45402}I wouldn't say that.
{45432}{45640}But.....my allegiance is|to the law.
{45584}{45680}I'm paid to uphold the law.
{46026}{46140}What in heaven's name are you|talking about?
{46210}{46422}You may have misgivings, but don't go believing|that, Jack. That way lies damnation.
{46420}{46508}I'm in no danger of|damnation, Bill.
{46762}{46818}Here's the thing.
{46844}{46998}I don't give a fuck about your moral conflicts...
{46922}{46992}..you meatheaded shit sack.
{47020}{47094}That's more or less the thing.
{47118}{47248}I want you to go out there. You|and nobody else.
{47200}{47254}None of your little minions.
{47226}{47304}I want you to go out there...
{47308}{47366}...and I want you...
{47380}{47542}...to punish, the person...
{47478}{47564}...who's responsible...
{47592}{47766}...for murdering this poor|little rabbit.
{47846}{47906}Is that understood?
{47990}{48026}Right!
{48062}{48192}Help yourself to some decent meat|on the way out.
{49040}{49064}Damn it!
{49120}{49174}Is that you, boy?
{49202}{49308}I didn't mean nothing by that shot|you know?
{49294}{49360}You scared me is all.
{49412}{49516}You know I'd never do you harm.
{49502}{49568}Come out now, lad.
{49612}{49694}Remember your father and me?
{49752}{49884}Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?
{49882}{49968}The times we had.
{50086}{50152}You know I won't hurt you.
{50914}{50974}This is bad for everybody.
{50944}{51028}What's next, dead politicians?
{51042}{51146}I could spare half a dozen|of you...
{51110}{51178}...easier than I can spare him.
{51184}{51328}Still, I think it shows dash.
{51279}{51417}Give the boy some time, we'll|settle with a good dust up.
{52129}{52176}The lads!
{52415}{52550}There are more of us coming off|the ships each day.
{52512}{52614}I heard 15,000 Irish a week.
{52626}{52702}And we're afraid of the Natives!
{52734}{52790}Get all of us together...
{52762}{52826}....we ain't got a gang..
{52804}{52852}...we got an army.
{52841}{53050}And all we need is a spark. One|spark, to wake us all up.
{53379}{53444}It was me who played you false.
{53478}{53544}I'd take it back if I could.
{53510}{53567}Take it back?
{53650}{53722}Johnny, I ought to kill you!
{54041}{54144}Get out of the Points and|don't come back.
{54304}{54354}Where are you going, boil?
{54382}{54414}Come along.
{54426}{54454}Come on.
{54524}{54610}Tell us John, what's the trouble?
{54616}{54672}No trouble, Bill.
{54729}{54810}Still hiding out with| your friends?
{54866}{55041}No, I'm not with them, Bill.
{54984}{55096}I'm with you, with the Natives.
{55167}{55324}You always were a Native, as far|as I'm interested, John.
{55322}{55414}Till you became a stag.
{55479}{55562}You tell me you're a Native?
{55520}{55582}Do you want to know what|a Native is?
{55614}{55876}A Native is a man, who's|willing to give his life...
{55772}{55838}...for his country.
{55855}{55940}Like my father done.
{55990}{56116}Are you willing to do that,| my young friend?
{56294}{56374}John? Johnny?
{56555}{56588}Johnny?
{56822}{56855}I'll get you off.
{57174}{57246}It hurts too much.
{57384}{57434}Just kill me.
{57546}{57608}Just kill me.
{57641}{57738}Please. Please.
{57854}{57966}Please. Please.
{58008}{58038}Please.
{58154}{58210}I'm sorry, Johnny.
{58594}{58696}Oh, Mary mother of God, pray|for us sinners...
{58646}{58740}...on the day of our death...amen.
{58744}{58808}Rest in peace, Ma.
{58864}{58920}What are you doing here, boil?
{59076}{59179}What's that nigger doing in| this church?
{59255}{59358}What's a Dead Rabbit doing with|the Natives,huh?
{59308}{59388}No niggers among the Natives.
{59348}{59420}Niggers as robbers is|one thing...
{59384}{59502}...but niggers in a church,|that's something else!
{59460}{59526}You run with the Natives, you go|pray with the Natives!
{59494}{59616}You're going to wind up on a stake|like your man did!
{59574}{59602}McGloin?
{59620}{59782}Father! Jezus, do you know there's|a nigger in your church?
{60160}{60217}Jezus!
{60760}{60816}The earth turns...
{60836}{60920}...but we don't feel it move.
{60964}{61044}And one night you look up...
{61055}{61272}...one spark and the skie's on fire.
{61454}{61534}It's a touching spectacle.
{61558}{61666}We'll come back when you're|ready for us.
{61790}{61905}The past is the torch that|lights our way.
{61886}{61978}Where our fathers have shown|us the path.
{61960}{62020}We shall follow.
{62058}{62210}Our faith is the weapon most|feared by our enemies...
{62164}{62266}...for thereby shall we lift our|people up...
{62214}{62314}...against those who will|destroy us.
{62290}{62500}Our name is called the Dead Rabbits,|to remind all of our suffering...
{62410}{62522}...and as a call to those who|suffer still...
{62466}{62534}...to join our ranks.
{62512}{62740}However so far they may have strayed|from our common home across the sea.
{62626}{62817}For with great numbers, must come|great strength.
{62741}{62828}For the salvation of our people.
{62828}{62872}We don't want your business.
{62850}{62890}How many other men live here?
{62882}{62924}You all have to register.
{62902}{62988}You can't force me to join|no army.
{62954}{62996}Have you got 300 dollars?
{62976}{63002}Of course not!
{62988}{63055}Who the hell's got 300 dollars?
{63022}{63166}If you are drafted, release from militairy| service can only be secured...
{63104}{63224}...for 300 dollars, according to|the conscription act.
{63164}{63191}300 Dollars?
{63178}{63238}Otherwise you have to serve!
{63208}{63278}Who the hell's got 300 dollars?
{63241}{63278}You have to serve, sir!
{63260}{63290}You tell me!
{63322}{63350}Boys!
{63386}{63494}I was born here, sir. You|immigrated here!
{63484}{63605}Sweet jezus. War does terrible|things to men.
{63562}{63638}Get back up town, where you|belong!
{63600}{63734}300 dollars. It's another rich|man's war!
{63710}{63808}Sir, I request an audience|with this man.
{63824}{63910}Don't they speak English in|New York anymore!
{63879}{63938}Don't understand.
{63908}{63958}You do speak English!
{63976}{64191}I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle| her rifle in another direction?
{64210}{64391}I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand|the value of this sort of publicity?
{64376}{64578}The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder|with half the Irish in the Five Points.
{64526}{64646}I'm offering my boy, to form an|alliance with you...
{64586}{64716}...against Bill Cutting and his|slate of Native candidates.
{64676}{64812}I'll negotiate a handsome fee, for|every Irish vote...
{64744}{64867}...you send Tammany's way, in the|coming elections.
{64866}{64962}I need a new friend in the Five|Points, son.
{65017}{65084}I'd like that friend to| be you.
{65155}{65238}Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed.
{65222}{65314}Suppose we do get you those votes.
{65354}{65472}Would you back an Irish candidate|of my chosing..
{65412}{65446}I don't think so.
{65429}{65510}What if we get you all the|Irish votes?
{65470}{65644}Mr. Vallon, that will only happen|in the reign of Queen Dick!
{65628}{65668}Beg your pardon?
{65648}{65712}That means it will never happen.
{65680}{65810}Now I might be persuaded to back|an Irish candidate...
{65744}{65798}...for, let's say alderman.
{65772}{65790}Alderman?
{65792}{65888}We've already got an Irish|alderman.
{65840}{65884}So we have, that's why....
{65862}{65928}What's bigger than an alderman?
{65960}{65994}Sheriff!
{65998}{66034}Sheriff!
{66024}{66176}Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an|Irishman for sheriff...
{66100}{66186}...of the city and county of|New York...
{66144}{66240}...and we'll get him elected.
{66192}{66248}I love the Irish, son...
{66220}{66328}..but higher than alderman you|shall never climb.
{66274}{66312}Why not?
{66308}{66444}For one thing, no man living can|consolidate the Irish vote.
{66376}{66398}I can!
{66386}{66464}And for another, I mean no|offence...
{66442}{66514}...no one's yet found an Irish|candidate...
{66478}{66552}...for sheriff worth voting for.
{66602}{66626}Monk!
{66658}{66678}Here.
{66800}{66916}Got me looking as sober as me own|grandfather!
{66858}{66924}He was a great man, I'm sure.
{66902}{66984}He was a drunken bastard.
{67018}{67074}Can I say what I want?
{67088}{67150}That's why I wanted you.
{67148}{67288}Our elected representatives are a|gang of thieves!
{67218}{67298}Who swear to better our lot...
{67270}{67360}...while dipping their hands deep|into our pockets.
{67328}{67554}I stand shoulder to shoulder with|community leaders like Bill Cutting...
{67440}{67636}....against any, an all in roads in|our democracy.
{67538}{67622}I'll see to it, that no one|takes away...
{67590}{67694}... what you earned by pluck and application.
{67642}{67754}To invading hordes of Hibernians.
{67696}{67784}Go to the polls and put|your mark...
{67748}{67846}... next to the name Walter McGinn.
{67798}{67926}Against the potatoes weeders, like|them over there...
{67876}{67944}...thieving our jobs.
{67910}{68038}Why should so many Irish die down|south...
{67974}{68028}...when the first war to win...
{68000}{68102}...is not down in Dixie, but|right here...
{68052}{68102}...in these streets!
{68142}{68240} Who's the finest streetfighter in|the Five Points?
{68200}{68246}Monk!
{68232}{68372}That's right and let the whole|damn city hear it!
{68362}{68446}That man was right born for this.
{68404}{68552}He's killed 44 men and laid low a|couple of hundred more.
{68484}{68542}Is that right?
{68512}{68532}Right.
{68530}{68596}I should have run him for mayor!
{68628}{68678}Alright, line 'm up.
{68666}{68734}It's election day!
{68946}{69012}Come on, you bastard. We need|your vote.
{68988}{69080}Bastard? I fought for you|nigger...
{69042}{69098}...I lost an arm for you!
{69070}{69154}Well, that's a start. Come on.
{69112}{69202}Rise and shine, rise and shine.
{69170}{69322}This great country of ours, even|hop fiends get their vote.
{69276}{69368}Less heart and more haste,|darling.
{69322}{69370}Where are you going ?
{69346}{69414}I already voted today.
{69388}{69494}Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!
{69448}{69478}Twice.
{69462}{69494}Twice?
{69486}{69580}Only twice? You call that doing|your civic duty?
{69538}{69574}Come with me.
{69564}{69672}Oh no, you don't. Get back and|sit down.
{69626}{69690}Here's another one!
{69662}{69696}Clean him up good.
{69678}{69818}Shave the beards off boys and send|them back to vote again.
{69748}{69836}Okay boys, vote Tammany.
{69798}{69854}Tammany!
{69826}{69976}What our great city needs is a new|court house.
{69900}{70036}Now I propose it should be a|modest, economical structure.
{69968}{70020}Excuse me one moment.
{69994}{70014}What is it?
{70018}{70202}Monk's already won by 3,000 more|votes, then there are voters.
{70110}{70186}Only 3? Make it 20, 30.
{70148}{70248}We don't need a victory, we need a|Roman triumph.
{70198}{70292}We don't have anymore ballots.
{70258}{70348}Remember the first rule of|politics...
{70302}{70374}...ballots don't make the results...
{70338}{70480}..the counters do. Keep counting.
{71182}{71230}It's from Bill.
{71310}{71334}Monk?
{71820}{71916}Citizens of the Five Points!
{71904}{72022}Mr. Cutting is attempting to|draw me...
{71964}{72018}...into an argument...
{72002}{72080}...that would no doubt end in|bloodshed...
{72042}{72140}...and the compromising of my|office.
{72128}{72180}What do you think?
{72196}{72358}Shall I engage in silence, this|relic of the ancient law...
{72288}{72438}...or, shall I be your chosen|voice...
{72364}{72512}...in a new testament, in a new|world?
{72586}{72632}There you are, Bill.
{72668}{72726}The people have spoken.
{72754}{72894}The very notion of violent|reprisal benumbs them.
{72904}{72930}Come on up.
{72958}{73002}Let's see if we can resolve our...
{72980}{73046}...grievances the democratic way.
{73598}{73776}That my friends, is the minority|vote.
{73736}{73866}Now you tasted my mutton, how do|you like it?
{73840}{73974}Look, I want you to see this.
{74004}{74090}This is you, right here!
{74058}{74230}Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard.
{74424}{74476}Why don't you burn him?
{74450}{74538}See if his ashes turn green.
{74638}{74732}Fortune favours them all!
{75002}{75076}You killed an elected official?
{75066}{75120}Who elected him?
{75094}{75174}You don't know what you've done|to yourself.
{75304}{75366}I know your works.
{75378}{75462}You're neither cold nor hot.
{75434}{75530}So because you are luke warm...
{75482}{75582}...I will spew you out of my|mouth.
{75578}{75702}You can build your filthy world|without me.
{75640}{75768}I took the father, now I'll take|the son.
{75704}{75828}You tell young Vallon, I'm going|to paint...
{75766}{75854}...Paradise square with his blood.
{75822}{75886}Two coats!
{75882}{75998}I'll festoon my sleeping|chamber with his guts.
{75940}{76056}As for you Mr. Tammany|fucking hall...
{75998}{76116}...you come down to the Points|once more...
{76056}{76196}...and you'll be dispatched by my|own hand!
{76190}{76248}Now get back to your|celebration...
{76218}{76296}...and let me eat in peace.
{76258}{76312}I paid you fair.
{76892}{76916}Down!
{76952}{76972}Raise!
{78022}{78070}You son of a bitch!
{78168}{78196}Challenge.
{78248}{78298}Challenge accepted.
{79544}{79600}And then it came...
{79596}{79674}...the first day of the draft.
{79634}{79670}Thomas O'neill.
{79682}{79722}Andrew Lewis.
{79738}{79788}Joseph Flynn.
{79762}{79924}They read out the draftees names|as if they were dead already.
{79892}{79956}J.B. Gleeson.
{79958}{79994}The O'Conell Guard.
{80000}{80034}The Plug Uglies.
{80026}{80042}As for us.
{80034}{80074}The Forty Thieves.
{80058}{80106}The tribes were gathered.
{80108}{80148}The Chichesters.
{80128}{80192}The drums were beating.
{80174}{80210}The Dead Rabbits.
{80210}{80256}The American guard.
{80252}{80300}The Atlantic Guard.
{80284}{80336}The Slaughterhouses.
{80310}{80372}The Bowery Boys.
{80352}{80438}Confederation of American Natives.
{80444}{80488}James Mooney.
{80476}{80536}But all we could see...
{80526}{80600}...was the hand in front of us.
{80562}{80604}Shaun O'Connell.
{80626}{80702}C.W. Morris.
{80722}{80748}When?
{80746}{80802}Whenever you like.
{80784}{80832}Daybreak tomorrow.
{80820}{80842}Ground?
{80854}{80884}Paradise square.
{80902}{80928}Weapons?
{80944}{81006}That I leave up to you.
{80992}{81082}Bricks, bats, axes, knives.
{81078}{81116}Pistols?
{81154}{81202}No pistols.
{81208}{81258}Good boy.
{81322}{81374}Terms are resolved.
{81348}{81400}Counsel is concluded.
{81546}{81614}To hell with your damned draft.
{81588}{81644}Get 'm boys.
{81616}{81668}Rip 'm apart.
{81830}{81900}Kill the rich bastards.
{82040}{82084}Hotel!
{82116}{82202}They're not getting my son!
{82294}{82386}Uptown town at the draft office...
{82356}{82454}...the cops broke a few skulls.
{82420}{82494}And everybody ran away.
{82502}{82580}But the word was spreading...
{82566}{82630}...in the dark.
{82638}{82800}Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns|and their mob...
{82720}{82806}...breathed a little easy.
{82762}{82912}Just a brief blist of anger, over|Mr. Lincoln's draft.
{82838}{82926}Entirely justifiable in my view.
{82894}{82964}There are two sides to that|question.
{82928}{83052}Ther are several sides to that|question, Mr. Schermerhorn.
{82990}{83068}But only one right side.
{83030}{83136}As with any question, it|holds the abuse...
{83082}{83132}...of any executive power.
{83108}{83200}In any case, Mr. Greely...
{83154}{83296}...we can all be thankful, it|wasn't any worse.
{83238}{83318}It may be worse yet, sir.
{83278}{83360}I saw them. I don't know|what to think...
{83318}{83454}What is it you are so fond of|saying, Mr. Tweed?
{83386}{83472}Mr. Greely, you won't like this...
{83430}{83482}...but what is it?
{83456}{83508}I don't remember.
{83482}{83608}You can always hire one half| of the poor...
{83544}{83618}...to kill the other half.
{83848}{83912}I've come to say goodbye.
{83912}{84002}I've booked passage for|California.
{84042}{84144}Jenny, give me one more day and|I'll go with you.
{84112}{84174}You'll be dead by then.
{84182}{84242}What would you have me do?
{84212}{84252}I don't know.
{84328}{84400}This will all be finished|tomorrow.
{84376}{84426}No it won't.
{84508}{84608}This whole place is going to|burn anyway.
{84776}{84938}I've heard of the poor are going|from door to door...
{84858}{85072}...in the Five Points, asking those|supporters for further riots...
{84978}{85082}...to place a candle in the|window.
{85064}{85150}Irish, Poles, Germans.
{85134}{85274}Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad...
{85218}{85332}...I prophesise a dark night.
{85820}{85886}Nobody goes to work today.
{85862}{85952}We're shutting the factories down!
{85906}{85996}When the sun rose next...
{85962}{86052}...the city had split in half.
{86022}{86116}From all over New York|they came...
{86068}{86198}...ironworkers, factory boys,|street cleaners!
{86134}{86224}Irish, Polish, German...
{86178}{86312}...anyone who never cared about|slavery in the Union.
{86258}{86334}Anyone who couldn't buy his way out.
{86322}{86376}Let the sons of the rich...
{86348}{86420}....go and die they cried.
{86396}{86460}Let the sons of the poor...
{86428}{86486}...stay home.
{86496}{86578}The earth was shaking now.
{86562}{86668}But I was about my father's business.
{86976}{87046}Oh, mighty Lord...
{87032}{87136}...you are the dagger in|my hand.
{87110}{87224}Guide my hand on this day of|vengeance.
{87168}{87268}We give thanks to the Lord....
{87228}{87302}...for He is good.
{87278}{87388}With you, the swift cannot flee.
{87334}{87426}Nor the strong escape.
{87380}{87582}Let my sword devour, till its thirst|is quenched with blood....
{87480}{87570}...and my enemy sleeps forever.
{87538}{87648}For you and the God of|retribution.
{87592}{87712}For the Lord crushes the wicked.
{87652}{87740}The Lord is merciful.
{87738}{87888}And his love endures forever.
{87838}{87872}Amen.
{87856}{87890}Amen.
{87872}{87910}Amen.
{88212}{88260}Get the women upstairs!
{88462}{88564}From 18th precinct. The mob is|ransacking houses...
{88514}{88596}....in 27th street and 7th|avenue.
{88554}{88636}We have no force to send.
{88596}{88648}From 15th precinct.
{88622}{88726}All the stores are closing on|8th avenue.
{88674}{88770}From fear of the mob in 17th|street.
{88838}{88862}From 4th.
{88850}{88962}The rioters are attacking|coloured boarding houses...
{88906}{88990}...robbing them and setting them|on fire.
{88948}{88988}From 21st.
{88968}{89062}The mob have just broken open|a gun store...
{89014}{89110}...on 3rd avenue and are arming.
{89254}{89348}Marshall's office on 3rd avenue|is burning down.
{89300}{89366}The police is of no avail.
{89334}{89396}Show yourself, please!
{89364}{89456}Two coloured men brought in|almost dead.
{89410}{89486}There are 50 more outside.
{89448}{89490}They need help.
{89470}{89554}The blacks are being attacked|all over the city.
{89512}{89606}There's the 300 dollar man!
{89564}{89586}Get him!
{89596}{89668}Did your daddy buy you out of|the army!
{89638}{89706}Can he buy me out of the|army too?
{89690}{89784}There is danger of mob|attacking armoury...
{89736}{89836}...corner 21st street, 2nd|avenue.
{89798}{89888}There's about 500 stand of arms|in it.
{90004}{90076}The line is dead. They're trying|to cut all the wires!

{103138}{103244}I want every man and woman|coming off the boats...
{103198}{103274}...given hot soup and bread.
{103359}{103481}We're burying a lot of votes|here tonight.
{103868}{103920}In the end....
{103894}{103983}...they put candles on the|bodies...
{103938}{104074}...so their friends, if they|had any...
{104031}{104107}...could know them in the dark.
{104111}{104230}The city did this free|of charge.
{104222}{104478}Shang, Jimmy Spoils, Hellcat.|McGloin and more.
{104406}{104480}Friend or foe...
{104457}{104544}...it didn't make no difference|now.
{104983}{105061}It was four days and nights...
{105022}{105172}..before the worst of the mob|was finally put down.
{105148}{105266}We never knew how many New|Yorkers died...
{105206}{105340}...that week, before the city|was finally delivered.
{105320}{105508}My father told me we was all|born of blood and tribulation.
{105464}{105635}And so then too, was our|great city.
{105638}{105702}But for those of us who...
{105670}{105792}...lived and died in them|furious days...
{105756}{105844}...it was like everything we|knew...
{105811}{105908}...was mildly swept away.
{105904}{106068}And no matter what they did to|build this city up again...
{106032}{106108}...for the rest of time...
{106124}{106264}...would be like no one ever|knew we were here.

{424}{524}Drink up me 'earties yo ho!
{529}{629}We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot.
{644}{744}Drink up me 'earties yo ho!
{762}{862}Yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me.
{922}{1022}We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack.|Drink up
{1057}{1157}Quiet, missy,|cursed pirates sail these waters.
{1160}{1197}You dont want to bring them|down on us now, do ya?
{1197}{1297}Mr. Gibbs that will do!|- She was singing about pirates.
{1317}{1459}Bad luck to be singing about pirates with us|mired in this unnatural fog. Mark my words.
{1459}{1507}Consider them marked.
{1544}{1579}On your way.
{1579}{1599}Aye, Lieutenant.
{1604}{1659}Its bad luck to have a woman on board, too,
{1662}{1710}even a miniature one.
{1730}{1820}I think itd be rather exciting|to meet a pirate.
{1827}{1872}Think again, Miss Swann.
{1897}{1972}Vile and dissolute creatures,|the lot of them.
{1972}{2047}I intend to see to that any man who sails|under a pirate flag or...
{2047}{2117}...wears a pirate brand|gets what he deserves.
{2129}{2202}A short drop and a sudden stop.
{2282}{2369}Lieutenant Norrington,|I appreciate your fervor.
{2369}{2467}But Im…Im concerned about the effect|this subject will have upon my daughter.
{2467}{2522}My apologies, Governor Swann.
{2522}{2622}- Actually, I find it all fascinating.|- Yes, thats what concerns me.
{3332}{3380}Look, a boy!|Theres a boy in the water!
{3447}{3495}Man overboard!
{3602}{3627}Haul him aboard!
{3857}{3904}Hes still breathing.
{3904}{3952}Mary, Mother of God!
{4129}{4157}What happened here?
{4170}{4255}Its most likely the powder magazine.|Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
{4350}{4385}A lot of good it did them.
{4397}{4470}Everyones thinking it.|Im just saying it...
{4470}{4567}Piratas!|- Theres no proof of that.
{4567}{4602}It was probably an accident.
{4662}{4697}Rouse the Captain immediately! .|- Hay, sir.
{4709}{4759}Heave to and take in sail,|launch the boats.
{4842}{4942}Elizabeth I want you to accompany the boy.|Hell be in your charge.
{4977}{5015}Take care of him.
{5504}{5527}Its ok.
{5547}{5587}My names Elizabeth Swann.
{5612}{5672}Will Turner.
{5682}{5732}Im watching over you, Will.
{6057}{6130}- Youre a pirate!|- Has he said anything?
{6145}{6225}His name is William Turner,|thats all I found out.
{6259}{6297}Take him below.
{8062}{8112}Elizabeth!
{8137}{8174}Are you alright?
{8209}{8307}Are you decent?|- Yes, yes!
{8332}{8432}Still abed at this hour?|Its a beautiful day.
{8522}{8570}I have a gift for you.
{8667}{8715}- Oh, its beautiful!|- Isnt it?.
{8762}{8797}May I inquire as to the occasion?.
{8797}{8897}Does a father need an occasion|to dote upon his daughter?
{8929}{8952}Go on.
{9039}{9087}Actually, I, uh...
{9112}{9172}I had hoped you might wear|it for the ceremony today.
{9172}{9197}The ceremony?
{9197}{9272}Captain Norringtons|promotion ceremony.
{9280}{9317}I knew it!
{9325}{9405}Commodore Norrington|hes about to become.
{9405}{9497}Fine gentleman, dont you think.|He fancies you?
{9532}{9582}Elizabeth?|Hows it coming?
{9617}{9664}Its difficult to say.
{9664}{9732}Im told its the latest|fashion in London.
{9732}{9797}Well, women in London mustve|learned not to breathe.
{9857}{9904}My lord, you have a visitor.
{10362}{10422}Ah, Mr. Turner,|good to see you again.
{10434}{10459}Good day, sir.
{10494}{10532}I have your order.
{10697}{10797}The blade is folded steel, thats gold|filigree laid into the handle.
{10829}{10882}If I may?
{10915}{11015}Perfectly balanced. The tang is|nearly the full width of the blade.
{11095}{11145}Impressive, very impressive.
{11205}{11289}Ah, now, Commodore Norrington is|going to be very pleased with this.
{11302}{11372}Do pass my compliments|on to your Master.
{11432}{11469}I shall.
{11479}{11577}A craftsman is always pleased|to hear his work is appreciated.
{11624}{11722}- Ah, Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning.|- Will.
{11747}{11795}So good to see you!
{11805}{11902}- I had a dream about you last night.|- About me?
{11902}{11962}Elizabeth, is that entirely|proper for you to...?
{11962}{12005}About the day we met,|do you remember?
{12005}{12055}How could I forget, Miss Swann?
{12055}{12129}Will, how many times must|I ask you to call me Elizabeth?
{12129}{12214}At least once more,|Miss Swann, as always.
{12214}{12297}There, see.
{12297}{12312}At least the boy has|a sense of propriety.
{12312}{12372}Now, we really must be going.|Farewell.
{12404}{12467}Good day, Mr. Turner.
{12477}{12515}Come along.
{12587}{12622}Good day...
{12682}{12707}...Elizabeth.
{14967}{14989}What?
{14992}{15055}Hold up there, you.
{15075}{15162}Its a shilling to tie up your|boat at the dock.
{15220}{15270}And I shall need to|know your name.
{15317}{15415}What dye say to three shillings|and we forget the name?
{15509}{15557}Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.
{16474}{16527}Two paces front!
{16579}{16642}Right about turn!
{16700}{16740}Present...
{16740}{16775}...arms!
{17362}{17432}This dock is off limits to civilians.
{17432}{17505}Im terribly sorry, I didnt know.|If I see one...
{17505}{17555}...I shall inform you immediately.
{17625}{17722}Apparently theres some sort of a high toned|and fancy to do up at the fort, eh?
{17722}{17867}How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen|such as yourselves did not merit an invitation?
{17867}{17952}Someone has to make sure this|dock stays off limits to civilians.
{17952}{18052}Its a fine goal to be sure but|it seems to me that a...
{18059}{18159}a ship like that makes this one|here a bit superfluous, really.
{18179}{18274}Ah, the Dauntless is the power in these waters,|true enough, but theres no ship...
{18274}{18347}...that can match the|Interceptor for speed.
{18347}{18447}Ive heard of one, supposed to be|very fast, nigh un-catchable...
{18470}{18517}"The Black Pearl"
{18565}{18650}Well…theres no real ship that|can match the Interceptor.
{18687}{18782}- The Black Pearl is a real ship.|- No, no its not.
{18782}{18849}- Yes, it is, Ive seen it.|- Youve seen it?
{18849}{18929}- Yes.|- You havent seen it.
{18929}{18954}Yes, I have.
{18954}{19054}Youve seen a ship with black sails...
{19054}{19147}...thats crewed by the damned and|captained by a man so evil...
{19147}{19247}...that Hell itself spat him back?|- Ne.
{19272}{19307}Ne.
{19307}{19392}But I have seen a ship|with black sails.
{19392}{19492}Oh, and no ship thats not crewed by|the damned and captained by a man so evil...
{19500}{19550}...that Hell itself spat him|back out could possibly...
{19550}{19597}...have black sails therefore couldnt|possibly be any other ...
{19597}{19679}...ship than the Black Pearl.|Is that what you're saying?
{19704}{19747}Ne.
{19747}{19847}Like I said… theres no real ship|that can match the Interceptor
{19917}{19954}Hey!
{19972}{20030}You!
{20030}{20122}Get away from there!|You dont have permission to be aboard there, mate.
{20122}{20197}Im sorry, its just its such|a pretty boat  ship!
{20197}{20290}- Whats your name?|- Smith or...Smithy, if you like.
{20290}{20380}Whats your purpose in|Port Royal, Mr. Smith?
{20380}{20422}Yeah, and no lies!
{20422}{20562}Well, then, I confess, it is my intention|to commandeer one of these ships.
{20562}{20662}Pick up a crew in Tortuga,  raid, pillage, plunder|and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.
{20679}{20727}I said no lies.
{20727}{20757}I think hes telling the truth.
{20757}{20847}If he were telling the truth,|he wouldnt have told us.
{20847}{20947}Unless, of course, he knew you wouldnt|believe the truth even if he told it to you.
{21205}{21230}May I have a moment?
{21469}{21569}You look lovely, Elizabeth.|- Yes?
{21572}{21780}I apologize if I seem forward but I...|must speak my mind
{21782}{21882}This promotion throws into sharp|relief that which I have...
{21912}{22037}...not yet achieved.|A marriage to a fine woman.
{22072}{22154}You have become a fine|woman, Elizabeth.
{22154}{22197}I cant breathe.
{22197}{22277}Yes, Im a bit nervous myself.
{22347}{22412}...and then they made me their chief.
{22454}{22497}Elizabeth?
{22555}{22597}Elizabeth!
{22647}{22697}The rocks!|Sir, its a miracle she missed them!
{22772}{22832}- Will you be saving her then?|- I cant swim.
{22882}{22944}Pearl of the Kings Navy you are.
{22944}{22982}Do not lose these.
{23347}{23395}What was that?
{24447}{24472}I got her.
{24482}{24557}- Not breathing.|- Move!
{24719}{24757}Never would have thought of that.
{24757}{24844}Clearly youve never been to Singapore.
{24969}{25020}Where did you get that?
{25057}{25082}On your feet.
{25157}{25195}Elizabeth.
{25207}{25295}- Are you alright?|- Yes, Im fine.
{25395}{25432}- Shoot him!|- Father!
{25447}{25544}Commodore, do you really|intend to kill my rescuer?
{25697}{25769}I believe thanks are in order.
{25857}{25920}Had a brush with the East India|Trading company, did we?
{25920}{25970}Pirate?
{25987}{26020}- Hang him.
{26020}{26120}Keep your guns on him, men.|Gillette, fetch some irons.
{26145}{26245}- Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isnt it?|- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir.
{26294}{26394}- Well, I dont see your ship...Captain.|- Im in the market as it were.
{26444}{26532}- He said hed come to commandeer one.|- Told ya he was telling the truth.
{26532}{26594}These are his, sir.
{26644}{26732}No additional shots nor powder...
{26757}{26832}A compass that doesnt point north...
{26932}{27007}And I half expected it|to be made of wood.
{27057}{27144}You are, without doubt, the worst|pirate Ive ever heard of.
{27154}{27219}But you have heard of me.
{27269}{27319}Commodore, I really must protest.
{27349}{27374}Carefully Lieutenant.
{27374}{27432}Pirate or not this man saved my life.
{27432}{27527}One good deed is not enough to redeem|a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
{27527}{27590}Though it seems enough|to condemn him.
{27590}{27632}Indeed.
{27645}{27682}Finally.
{27720}{27745}No, dont shoot!
{27745}{27845}I knew youd warm up to me.|Commodore Norrington, my effects, please...
{27845}{27890}...and my hat.
{27919}{27939}Commodore!
{28007}{28107}- Elizabeth, it is Elizabeth isnt it?|- Its Miss Swann.
{28107}{28207}Miss Swann, if youd be so kind.|Come, come, dear, we dont have all day.
{28269}{28319}Now if youd be very kind..
{28707}{28782}Easy on the goods, darling.
{28782}{28844}Youre despicable.
{28844}{28944}Sticks and stones, love. I saved your|life, you saved mine, were square.
{28979}{29044}Gentlemen, mlady.
{29044}{29124}you will always remember this as|the day that you almost caught...
{29124}{29182}...Capitan Jack Sparrow.
{29657}{29739}- Now, will you shoot him?|- Open fire!
{29914}{29949}On his heels!
{30419}{30519}Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn|appointment with the gallows...
{30519}{30574}...I would hate for him to miss it.
{33107}{33207}Right where I left you.
{33332}{33357}Not where I left you.
{33620}{33670}You're the one they're hunting.
{33695}{33732}The pirate.
{33932}{33994}Ah. Well, then it would be a shame to|put a black mark on your record.
{33994}{34032}So, if you'll excuse me...
{34129}{34187}Do you think this wise, boy...
{34187}{34245}...crossing blades with a pirate?
{34280}{34320}You threatened Miss Swann.
{34400}{34457}Only a little.
{34757}{34844}You know what youre doing,|Ill give you that. Excellent form...
{34857}{34919}...but hows your footwork?
{34919}{35020}If I step here...|Very good.
{35037}{35080}Now I step again.
{35207}{35240}Ta.
{35732}{35784}That is a wonderful trick.
{35794}{35895}Except once again you are|between me and my way out.
{35897}{35980}And now you have no weapon.
{36532}{36569}Who makes all these?
{36614}{36695}I do!|And I practice with them...
{36707}{36745}...three hours a day!
{36777}{36837}You need to find yourself a girl, mate.
{37027}{37122}Or, perhaps the reason you practice three|hours a day is that you already found one ...
{37122}{37222}...and are otherwise incapable|of wooing said strumpet.
{37234}{37279}You're not a eunuch, are you?
{37294}{37369}I practice three hours a day,|so that when I meet a pirate...
{37369}{37407}...I can kill it.
{39327}{39355}You cheated.
{39372}{39392}Pirate.
{39470}{39520}- Move away.|- No.
{39532}{39594}- Please, move.|- No!
{39594}{39644}I cannot just step aside|and let you escape.
{39719}{39779}This shot is not meant for you.
{40032}{40070}Move in!
{40145}{40282}Excellent work, Mr. Brown . Youve assisted|in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.
{40282}{40347}Just doing my civic duty, sir.
{40357}{40437}Well, I trust youll always remember|this as the day that Captain...
{40439}{40519}...Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
{40519}{40569}Take him away!
{40744}{40787}- Can you smell it.

{40900}{41000}You can keep doing that forever,|the dog is never going to move.

{50025}{50050}...you have to take me to your Captain.
{50060}{50110}I know the code.
{50115}{50170}If an adversary demands parley you|can do them no harm until ...
{50177}{50200}...the parley is complete.
{50207}{50237}To blazes with the code.
{50237}{50290}She wants to be taken to the Captain.
{50332}{50482}And shell go without a fuss.|We must honor the code.

{52845}{52902}No, no, no, no, no,|I didnt mean it. I didnt.
{53092}{53129}This aint the armory.
{53144}{53244}Well, well, well,|look what we have here Twigg?
{53267}{53322}Capitain Jack Sparrow.
{53354}{53517}Last time I saw you, you were all|alone on a godforsaken island.
{53517}{53617}Shrinking into the distance.|His fortunes arent improved much.
{53647}{53725}Worry about your own|fortunes, gentlemen.
{53730}{53829}The deepest circle of Hell is reserved|for betrayers and mutineers.
{53949}{53987}So there is a curse.
{54044}{54069}That's interestin.
{54077}{54124}You know nothing of Hell.
{54342}{54390}Thats very interesting.
{55287}{55322}I didnt know we were|takin on captives.
{55347}{55422}Shes invoked the right of parley|with Captain Barbossa.
{55429}{55514}- I am here to negotiate...|- You will speak when spoken to.
{55547}{55647}And yell not lay a hand on those|under the protection of parley.
{55667}{55709}Aye, sir.
{55774}{55799}My apologies, Miss.
{55850}{55950}Captain Barbossa, I am here to negotiate|the cessation of hostilities l ...
{55962}{55997}...against Port Royal.
{56010}{56110}There are a lot of long words in there, Miss,|were naught but humble pirates.
{56145}{56242}- What is it that you want?|- I want you to leave and never come back.
{56302}{56352}Im disinclined to acquiesce to your request...
{56419}{56457}...means no.
{56504}{56554}Very well.
{56592}{56612}I'll drop it.
{56745}{56837}Me holds are burstin' with swag and|that bit of shine matters to us?
{56870}{56957}- Why?|- Its what youve been searching for.
{56992}{57077}I recognized the ship. I saw it eight years|ago on the crossing from England.
{57087}{57119}Did ya now?
{57189}{57237}Fine.
{57239}{57339}Well, I suppose if it is worthless then|theres no point in me keeping it.
{57637}{57692}You have a name, Missy?
{57715}{57780}Elizabeth... Turner
{57815}{57865}Im a maid in the|Governors household.
{57944}{57969}Miss Turner.
{58042}{58062}Bootstrap.
{58174}{58237}And how does a maid come to|own a trinket such as that?
{58239}{58297}Family heirloom, perhaps?
{58329}{58405}I didnt steal it if thats what you mean.
{58405}{58505}Very well, you hand it over and well put your|town to our rudder and never return.
{58864}{58897}Our bargain?
{58969}{59032}Still the guns and stowem, ...The men.
{59052}{59152}Wait! You have to take me to shore.|According to the code of the order of the brethren...
{59152}{59250}First, your return to shore was|not part of our negotiations...
{59250}{59307}...nor our agreement so|I must do nothing.
{59307}{59407}And secondly, you must be a pirate for|the pirates code to apply and youre not
{59407}{59542}And thirdly, the code is more what you'd|call "guidelines" than actual rules.
{59542}{59634}Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,|Miss Turner.
{60165}{60212}Theyve taken her.|Theyve taken Elizabeth.
{60227}{60285}Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.
{60285}{60362}We have to hunt them down,|we must save her.
{60362}{60410}And where do you propose we start?
{60429}{60524}If you have any information concerning|my daughter, please, share it.
{60589}{60689}That Jack Sparrow.|He talked about the Black Pearl.
{60692}{60749}Mentioned it, is more what he did.
{60784}{60807}Ask him where it is.
{60812}{60865}Make a deal with him|he could lead us to it.
{60865}{60910}No...
{60910}{60987}the pirates who invaded this Fort left|Sparrow locked in his cell ergo....
{60987}{61042}...they are not his allies.
{61042}{61112}Governor, we will establish|their most likely course...
{61122}{61165}Thats not good enough!
{61190}{61289}Mr. Turner, you are not a military|man, you are not a sailor.
{61347}{61447}You are a blacksmith and this is|not the moment for rash actions.
{61519}{61582}Do not make the mistake of thinking|you are the only man here...
{61584}{61619}...who cares for Elizabeth.
{61920}{61937}You!
{61937}{61980}- Sparrow.|- Aye.
{61980}{62035}You are familiar with that ship,|the Black Pearl?
{62072}{62119}- Ive heard of it.|- Where does it make berth?
{62127}{62209}Where does it make berth?|Have you not heard the stories?
{62279}{62452}Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants|sailed from the dreaded Isla de Muerta.
{62452}{62552}Its an island that cannot be found except|by those who already know where it is.
{62590}{62622}The ships real enough.
{62647}{62717}Therefore its anchorage must be|a real place. Where is it?
{62740}{62822}- Why ask me?|- Because youre a pirate.
{62827}{62887}And you want to turn pirate|yourself, is that it?
{62927}{62949}Never.
{63044}{63127}- They took Miss Swann .|- Oh, so it is that youve found a girl.
{63127}{63182}I see.
{63182}{63324}Well, if youre intending to brave all, hasten|to her rescue and so win fair ladys heart...
{63324}{63425}...youll have to do it alone, mate.|I see no profit in it for me.
{63452}{63532}- I can get you out of here.|- Hows that? The keys run off.
{63537}{63625}I helped build these cells.|These are half pin-barrel hinges.
{63672}{63740}With the right leverage and|a proper application of strength...
{63784}{63812}...the door will lift free.
{63877}{63957}- Whats your name?|- Will Turner.
{63992}{64042}That will be short for William,|I imagine.
{64042}{64142}Good, strong name. No doubt,|named for your father, aye.
{64192}{64222}Yes.
{64290}{64355}Aha. Well, Mr. Turner,|Ive changed me mind.
{64375}{64445}If you spring me from this cell,|I swear on pain of death...
{64445}{64545}...I shall take you to the Black|Pearl and your bonny lass?
{64545}{64644}- Do we have an accord?
{64694}{64754}- Agreed.|- Agreed, get me out.
{64857}{64887}Hurry, someone will|have heard that.
{64892}{64932}Not without my effects.
{65105}{65135}Were going to steal a ship?
{65200}{65215}That ship?
{65215}{65315}Commandeer.|Were going to commandeer that ship.
{65317}{65347}Nautical term.
{65377}{65417}One question about your business boy,|or theres no use going.
{65459}{65559}This girl, how far are you|willing to go to save her?
{65572}{65624}- Id die for her.|- Oh, good.
{65632}{65667}No worries, then.
{66167}{66225}This is either madness or brilliance.
{66245}{66327}Its remarkable how often|those two traits coincide.
{67077}{67162}Everyone stay calm,|we are taking over the ship.
{67162}{67217}Aye, avast!
{67299}{67347}This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
{67377}{67412}You'll never make it out of the bay.
{67442}{67469}Son.
{67489}{67590}Im Captain Jack Sparrow, savvy?

{396}{483}My eye is a little itchy.
{487}{554}Mine too. Yeah.
{560}{635}It's really red.|You should go see my eye doctor.
{641}{695}I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.
{701}{791}That's all I hear.|Richard, Richard, Richard.
{797}{860}Since we've dated,|I've said his name twice.
{866}{941}Okay. So Richard, Richard.
{947}{1016}It's not Richard.|It's this new guy. He's good.
{1022}{1084}I'm sorry. I'm not going|to an eye doctor.
{1090}{1161}Oh, God. Here we go.
{1167}{1254}Anytime anything comes close|to touching her eye or anyone else's...
{1260}{1316}...she, like, freaks out. Watch.
{1322}{1355}Ross, come on!
{1361}{1483}I have a weird thing with my eye.|Can we not talk about it?
{1514}{1601}Hey, Rach. You know that great song?|"Me, myself and eye".
{1607}{1642}Monica! Come on!
{1648}{1716}All those in favor|of getting lunch, say "eye".
{1722}{1755}Ross! Stop it!
{1762}{1830}How much did I love|{y:i}The King and "Eye"!
{1837}{1857}Chandler!
{1864}{1887}Me too, me too!
{1893}{1982}Just stop it! That's enough!
{1984}{2092}- You okay there, man?|- Yeah. I got too excited.
{2105}{2193}The One with Joey's Big Break
{3299}{3351}I gotta go.|I'm taking Ben to the park.
{3357}{3436}- Give him a kiss for me.|- All right. Bye.
{3442}{3482}Later.
{3488}{3554}I'm so sorry you got caught|in the middle of that.
{3561}{3688}I didn't mean to be so out there,|but I am furious with him.
{3745}{3813}Calm down?
{3815}{3919}I'm trying.|Man, that guy can push my buttons!
{3919}{3956}Why are you so mad?
{3961}{4025}- I don't wanna talk about it.|- It seems like...
{4031}{4127}You wanna be on my list too?|Keep talking.
{4130}{4208}Has anyone seen my list by the way?
{4214}{4250}No. What's it look like?
{4256}{4364}- A piece of paper and it says "Ross".|- I see.
{4417}{4489}I just got off the phone with Estelle.|Guess what?
{4495}{4536}I got the lead!
{4542}{4605}You got the lead in a movie?|What's it about?
{4611}{4689}It's called "Shutterspeed".|It's really cool.
{4695}{4792}I meet this girl in the subway|and we fall in love in, like, a day.
{4798}{4891}And then she disappears.|But I find out where she lives.
{4897}{4975}This old lady answers the door.|I say, "Where's Betsy?"
{4981}{5137}And she says, "Betsy's been dead|for ten years."
{5164}{5187}Chilling!
{5193}{5280}The best part is we're filming|in the desert outside of Vegas.
{5286}{5335}- You know what that means.|- I know.
{5341}{5439}Road trip! We can rent a car.|I have to be there by Tuesday.
{5445}{5542}Wait! My grandmother's dead.
{5634}{5694}We can talk about that too, Pheebs.
{5700}{5723}No, her cab.
{5729}{5803}She probably won't be using it.|Drive it to Las Vegas.
{5809}{5845}All right! Thanks!
{5851}{5921}What are we gonna do about my job?
{5927}{5952}Not go.
{5958}{6033}Great! Road trip, baby!
{6035}{6055}Is this okay?
{6061}{6144}Chandler, you don't have to ask|for my permission.
{6150}{6200}You can go.
{6206}{6265}Rach, we'll be late|for the eye doctor.
{6271}{6372}All right. Let's get this over with.
{6445}{6556}Look what I did.
{6579}{6633}I mean, look at this mess.
{6639}{6698}We're gonna probably have to|clean this up.
{6704}{6786}I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!
{6792}{6891}If you thought that this mess|was gonna bother me, you are wrong!
{6897}{6978}All right, let's go, Blinky.
{7222}{7280}Hey, Joey. What's up?
{7286}{7355}I can't decide which route|to take to Vegas.
{7361}{7405}You've traveled a lot, right?
{7411}{7450}Yeah, I've been around.
{7456}{7534}Which route should I take?|The north or the south route?
{7541}{7664}If you take the north route,|there's a man with a beard of bees.
{7670}{7744}Great! Problem solved!
{7750}{7868}On the south route, there's a chicken|that plays tic-tac-toe.
{7873}{7939}Well, back to square one.
{7945}{7991}I know a way that you can decide.
{7997}{8097}I'll ask you a series of questions|and you answer as quickly as you can.
{8103}{8129}Yes!
{8134}{8199}Good. But wait.
{8215}{8271}Here we go. I want you to relax.

{8438}{8490}- Be a fireman or a swimmer?|- Swimmer.
{8496}{8598}- You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?|- Monica.
{8604}{8659}I always thought it'd be Rachel.
{8665}{8727}- No thinking. Tie or ascot?|- Ascot.
{8733}{8767}- North or south route?|- North.
{8773}{8839}Bam! There you go! Huh?
{8845}{8977}That was incredible!|Beard of bees here I come!
{9007}{9092}This guy again.
{9121}{9150}Hey, what's up?
{9156}{9211}Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?
{9217}{9250}What do you wanna see?
{9256}{9281}I don't know.
{9287}{9348}I know how to decide.|Show him your game.
{9354}{9427}No, thank you.
{9438}{9463}What's with her?
{9469}{9519}I don't know.|I know how we can decide.
{9525}{9600}I'm gonna ask you questions|and you answer real quick.
{9606}{9643}- Action or comedy?|- Action.
{9649}{9753}Who would you rather sleep with,|Monica or Rachel?
{9822}{9907}Dude, you are sick.
{9945}{10061}I'm sorry. I forgot you had|that whole Rachel thing.
{10166}{10266}Oh, my God. What does that thing do?
{10277}{10335}- An eye removal machine.|- I'm out of here.
{10341}{10379}I'm kidding.
{10385}{10425}Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.
{10431}{10508}Monica said you were nervous.|Everything will be fine.
{10514}{10591}- So we're done.|- Almost, but first we gotta start.
{10597}{10700}This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.
{10706}{10763}Put your chin here.
{10769}{10845}Now, you'll feel a small puff of air|in each eye.
{10851}{10889}What?
{10895}{11007}A small puff of air.|Now, come on!
{11012}{11050}Here we go.
{11056}{11177}One, two, three.
{11177}{11211}I'm sorry. All right.
{11217}{11280}I'm gonna stay in here this time.
{11286}{11310}Ready?
{11316}{11386}- One, two...|- I'm sorry.
{11392}{11453}You know what?|I'm gonna hold her head.
{11459}{11532}That's okay.
{11601}{11639}I'm sorry.
{11645}{11737}You're young.|You don't have glaucoma.
{11802}{11875}So it was very, very nice|to meet you, sir.
{11881}{11936}What are you...|Are you crazy?
{11942}{12027}You got a small, minor infection|in that left eye.
{12033}{12120}Take these drops for a week|and you'll be as good as new.
{12126}{12189}No, I don't put things in my eye.
{12195}{12297}We'll see you here in three months.|And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
{12303}{12379}Give me the damn drops!
{12389}{12449}Dr. Miller?
{12455}{12527}P-E-C-F-D.
{12528}{12622}Very good, Monica!
{12627}{12727}- You know where they are.|- I sure do.
{12780}{12862}And you don't get one.
{12936}{12994}You know, those eye drops|are a miracle.
{13000}{13044}My eye is 100% better.
{13050}{13141}- They're still in my coat.|- Damn!
{13149}{13172}You ready to go?
{13179}{13311}How cold will it be there?|Will all these sweater vests be enough?
{13316}{13393}- What?|- I love you.
{13415}{13482}I wish Ross was coming with us.|I'll miss him.
{13488}{13585}Thanks. I just got|that jerk out of my mind.
{13591}{13663}Is the movie putting us up|in a big hotel suite?
{13669}{13719}Not really.|It's an independent film.
{13725}{13836}We don't have a big budget.|I'll stay in your room.
{13841}{13916}Once you get paid,|you'll be springing for a suite.
{13922}{13969}They must be paying you a lot.
{13976}{14047}For every dollar "Shutterspeed" makes...
{14054}{14144}...one penny of it goes|right in Joey's pocket.
{14150}{14216}You don't get paid unless|it makes money?
{14222}{14304}Did you not hear the plot|of the movie?
{14310}{14388}"She's been dead for ten years."
{14394}{14482}I'm gonna be a millionaire!
{14502}{14541}I wanted to say goodbye.
{14547}{14626}And to see if you guys would|place a little bet for me.
{14632}{14687}Twenty bucks on black 15.
{14693}{14744}- You got it!|- All right.
{14751}{14819}- All right. Bye-bye, now.|- Bye, you guys.
{14826}{14890}I'll say bye at the car.

{14953}{15088}I'll say goodbye to you at the car|if you don't mind the pus.
{15115}{15150}See you!
{15156}{15287}But wait a minute. The pus is good.|It means it's healing.
{15350}{15437}Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?
{15541}{15607}Hello?
{15750}{15777}Come on!
{15783}{15863}Sorry, I didn't see you there.
{15885}{15953}Pheebs, are you mad at me|or something?
{15959}{16019}If you are, please tell me|what it is I did.
{16026}{16090}- If you don't know, I can't help you.|- I don't know.

{16169}{16301}Well, whatever it is,|I am very, very sorry. Okay?
{16307}{16372}Apology accepted.
{16392}{16457}So we're good?
{16552}{16590}I'll see you later, okay?
{16596}{16620}Bye, fat ass.
{16626}{16697}All right!
{16697}{16785}Will you please tell me what it is|that made you so mad at me?
{16791}{16881}I don't know! I don't remember!
{16887}{16967}If you can't remember,|can't we just forget about this?
{16973}{17051}Oh, no. I am mad at you.|I know that much.
{17057}{17211}But I'm sorry about the "fat ass" thing|because you have a sweet, little heinie.
{17384}{17479}I'm getting pretty tired.|You'll have to take over soon.
{17485}{17585}We've been driving for a half-hour.|You haven't looked at the road once.
{17591}{17687}Don't worry. It's out there.
{17699}{17765}Maybe I just need lunch.|You wanna eat?
{17771}{17828}My treat.
{17834}{17917}Isn't that Ross' money?
{17939}{17996}Ross' treat.|Where do you wanna eat?
{18002}{18028}I don't know.
{18034}{18074}I know how we can decide.
{18080}{18126}I'll ask you questions.
{18132}{18190}And then you have to answer real fast.
{18196}{18277}So clear your mind.|Clear it right out. Clear it out.
{18283}{18366}- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?|- Too dry.
{18372}{18406}- Do you believe in ghosts?|- No.
{18412}{18502}- Will this movie be my big break?|- No.
{18502}{18570}- What?|- Yes.
{18576}{18654}- Dude, you said, "No."|- I also said, "Yes."
{18660}{18762}- This won't be my big break?|- No.
{18796}{18831}I don't believe this.
{18837}{18921}Look, I just don't want you to get|your hopes up too high.
{18927}{18998}What are you talking about?|I'm the lead in a movie!
{19004}{19103}They're not even paying you!|This doesn't sound like a real movie!
{19109}{19181}I don't know why you're dumping|all over my big break.
{19187}{19252}I don't think this is gonna be|your big break.
{19258}{19326}Are you on this trip|to make me feel like a loser?
{19332}{19398}- I'd rather be alone.|- You don't want me here?
{19404}{19436}Not if you're like this.
{19442}{19516}The next time you ask me|a question like that, I'll lie.
{19522}{19561}I don't want you on the trip.
{19567}{19628}Why don't you pull over?|I'll get out now.
{19634}{19707}Fine.
{19733}{19752}Get out.
{19758}{19800}You can't stop on a bridge.
{19806}{19887}- Get out!|- Fine!
{19924}{19980}{Y:i}Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!
{19986}{20082}{Y:i}Yeah. I'm gonna die here.
{20119}{20234}Are you mad at me|because my hair gel smells?
{20241}{20321}Because I said your handwriting|is childlike?
{20327}{20398}No. That made me feel precious.
{20404}{20475}Because he's always|correcting people's grammar?
{20481}{20594}"Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!
{20594}{20676}Yeah? Sometimes it's...
{20711}{20808}Did you beat him at a board game?|He's such a baby when he loses.
{20814}{20845}Okay, I'm the baby.
{20851}{20927}Hey! Stop it!
{20941}{20980}What are you doing here?
{20986}{21043}Joey kicked me out of the car|on the bridge.
{21049}{21098}- Why?|- I don't know. He went crazy.
{21104}{21188}We played that game where you|ask questions and answer fast.
{21194}{21303}That game should not be played|without my supervision.
{21309}{21345}I don't know what made him mad.
{21351}{21420}All I said was that|this wouldn't be his big break...
{21426}{21477}...that it wouldn't do|anything for him...
{21483}{21524}...and that it didn't sound real.
{21530}{21596}Okay, he should've|pushed me off the bridge.
{21602}{21626}What's in the bag?
{21632}{21671}I figured you'd be mad at me...
{21677}{21751}...so I got gifts that I found|on the roadside.
{21757}{21854}- Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?|- I do!
{22054}{22137}- Not even close.|- I need help! I can't do this.
{22143}{22186}Come on. Let's do it.
{22192}{22312}Sit down.|All right, put your head back.
{22315}{22417}- Now, open your eyes.|- Okay, they are.
{22425}{22482}- How many fingers am I holding up?|- Four.
{22488}{22518}I was thinking four.
{22524}{22573}- Really?|- Yes!
{22579}{22651}Why don't we start|with a practice one?
{22657}{22721}- No drops.|- Great!
{22727}{22847}On three. One, two, three.
{22853}{22885}My pillow's all wet!
{22891}{22938}Well, you said it was practice!
{22944}{22970}Why did you move?
{22976}{23045}I knew you were lying!
{23066}{23111}- Come here.|- What are you doing?
{23117}{23165}Stop it! Oh, my God!
{23171}{23216}I am going...
{23222}{23265}Turn it over!
{23271}{23346}I am going to get...
{23352}{23391}...get these drops in your eye.
{23397}{23501}Oh, my God! You really are|freakishly strong.
{23507}{23545}Stop! Stop!
{23551}{23613}Stop it!
{23619}{23666}Damn, it's empty!
{23672}{23799}If Joey and Chandler walked in now,|we could make a fortune.
{23926}{23985}That is definitely Chandler,|Joey or Ross.
{23991}{24052}Or Rachel.
{24122}{24192}It's Joey.
{24196}{24277}Chandler told me what happened.|He's really upset.
{24283}{24430}Not as upset as he'll be when he finds|out what I did with his sweater vests.
{24442}{24475}What did you do to them?
{24481}{24582}There's a well-dressed|pack of dogs in Ohio.
{24624}{24695}I gotta ask Phoebe|something about the car.
{24701}{24746}{Y:i}Hold on one second.
{24752}{24800}- Hey, dude.|{y:i}- Hey, Pheebs.
{24806}{24878}This wooden box keeps sliding out.|What is it?
{24884}{24943}My grandma.
{25004}{25097}And thanks.|She's having a great time.
{25125}{25181}Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
{25187}{25249}Chandler's here.|He was wondering if...
{25255}{25336}I guess he ran out of change.
{25342}{25435}How am I gonna apologize to him|if he won't even talk to me?
{25441}{25539}Send him something. So when he|gets there, he'll know you're sorry.
{25545}{25677}That's a good idea. I wonder where|I could get a basket of porn?
{25683}{25762}No, don't say I'm sorry with porn.
{25768}{25826}You should send him|a carton of cigarettes.
{25832}{25905}Because that way he can trade it|for protection.
{25911}{25979}No. That's prison.
{26037}{26095}I know how we're gonna|figure this out.
{26101}{26129}Clear your mind...
{26135}{26249}...and answer the first thing|that comes into your head.
{26255}{26307}- Do you like flora or fauna?|- Fauna.
{26313}{26351}- Simon or Garfunkel?|- Garfunkel.
{26357}{26456}- Why are you mad?|- You said I was boring.
{26491}{26526}When did I say that?
{26532}{26605}Oh, my God! I remember now!|We were playing chess.
{26611}{26681}Phoebe, you and I|have never played chess.
{26687}{26810}Remember that time on the frozen lake?|We were playing. You said I was boring.
{26816}{26947}Then you took off your energy mask|and you were Cameron Diaz.
{26983}{27081}There's a chance this|may have been a dream.
{27741}{27808}Stanley!
{27808}{27876}Your leading man is here.|Let's get to work.
{27882}{27916}Slight change of plans.
{27922}{27973}We've shut down.
{27979}{28008}What? Why?
{28014}{28111}It's a money thing.|We don't have any.
{28139}{28191}You're kidding, right?
{28197}{28220}What?
{28227}{28281}It's probably just temporary.
{28287}{28366}We're hoping to get some money soon.|Just hang out.
{28372}{28418}Hang out? How long?
{28424}{28511}I don't know. A week. Maybe two.|The money'll turn up.
{28517}{28616}People always wanna invest in movies.|You're not rich?
{28622}{28683}Worth a shot.
{28692}{28807}Well, Joey. Let me know|where you're staying, okay?
{28832}{28895}Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
{28902}{28936}These got left for you.
{28942}{29005}Thanks.
{29011}{29132}"Congratulations on your big break."
{29870}{29932}{y:i}- Monica, it's Joey.|- Hey, Joey.
{29938}{29995}You remember me|even though you're a star.
{30001}{30117}{y:i}Come on. It'll be years|{y:i}before I forget you.
{30125}{30170}What's it like on a movie set?
{30177}{30251}Do you have a dressing room|and a chair with your name?
{30257}{30319}{Y:i}Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
{30325}{30395}{y:i}Tell Chandler he couldn't|{y:i}have been more wrong.
{30401}{30519}{Y:i}I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.
{30585}{30661}Sorry about that.|Thanks for waiting.
{30667}{30737}Everybody smile.
{30756}{30912}Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay|at Caesar's. We hope it's toga-rific.
{30929}{31012}Kill me. Kill me now.
{31108}{31189}Rach, can you pass me the "TV Guide"?
{31195}{31225}Go!
{31231}{31314}What are you doing?|Get off! Oh, my God!
{31320}{31397}Hold it open. Okay.

{27826}{28014}- Jak się czujesz, Elizabeth?|- Ożywiona!
{28920}{29054}Panie i panowie, przyjaciele!|Proszę o chwilę uwagi.
{29058}{29216}Jak zapewne Wiecie, jutro|mój syn Wictor Wyjeżdża, -
{29220}{29408}- aby rozpocząć karierę W zawodzie,|który nie jest mi całkiem obcy.
{29414}{29523}Cóż za skromność!
{29617}{29744}Żałuję jedynie, że nie ma tu...
{29749}{29889}...jego matki i mej zmarłej żony...
{29952}{30064}...która czułaby tę samą dumę...
{30123}{30274}...jaka i mnie dzisiaj|przepełnia.
{30327}{30414}Tak.
{30568}{30736}Pragnęła, abyś to otrzymał|po Wstąpieniu na uniwersytet.
{30741}{30845}Napisała tutaj:
{30907}{31055}"To jest dziennik|Wiktora Frankensteina."
{31108}{31220}Inne stronice są puste -
{31251}{31393}- zostaną Wypełnione uczynkami|szlachetnego żywota.
{32120}{32231}Powinniśmy Wrócić,|nim zauważą naszą nieobecność.
{32236}{32326}Jeszcze chwilkę.
{32376}{32495}Nie Wiem, kiedy znowu|się zobaczymy.
{32520}{32595}Kochany Wiktorze!
{32600}{32799}- Będzie mi brak twoich złośliwości.|- Kto będzie mnie rozśmieszał?
{33175}{33314}Jak żegnają się|bracia i siostry?
{33385}{33493}Może nie muszą tego robić.
{33497}{33619}Zrobię to, co ty.
{34027}{34141}Jesteś moją siostrą?
{34146}{34216}Siostrą...
{34221}{34300}...przyjaciółką...
{34305}{34385}...ukochaną.
{34421}{34539}- Żoną?|- Tak!
{34544}{34644}- Jedź ze mną. Poślub mnie dzisiaj!|- Nie.
{34649}{34868}- Więc zostanę z tobą.|- Bardzo pragnę zostać twoją żoną.
{34873}{35010}Podczas twojej nieobecności powinnam|być jednak tutaj.
{35015}{35199}Chcę tchnąć życie W ten dom.|Tu będą dorastać nasze dzieci.
{35246}{35379}Musisz Wyjechać i dokonać|Wielkich rzeczy.
{35405}{35520}Tak bardzo cię pragnę.
{35525}{35626}Będę na ciebie czekała.
{35631}{35764}Każdego lata, gdy przyjedziesz.
{35884}{36012}Za to W noc poślubną...
{36289}{36349}Dobrze Więc.
{36541}{36686}{C:$ffffff}{F:Times New Roman}INGOLSTADT. 1793
{37093}{37206}- Jak minęła panu podróż?|- Znośnie.
{37211}{37402}- Jedynie strych jest Wolny...|- Tego Właśnie potrzebuję.
{37407}{37606}Przywiozą mi tutaj|specjalistyczną aparaturę.
{37611}{37764}Na pewno rozumie pani, jak|Ważne jest przyzwoite laboratorium.
{37769}{37861}Putzi lubi pana.
{38075}{38182}Doskonale.
{38226}{38381}"Głupcy i próżniacy dowodzą swoich|racji za pomocą magicznej różdżki."
{38386}{38511}"Wiedza daje Władzę|jedynie dzięki Bogu."
{38516}{38679}Oto nasze motto. Niecierpliwi|młodzieńcy łatwo o nim zapominają.
{38750}{38953}Być może najpoważniejszym błędem|naszych studentów, -
{38958}{39069}- jest doprawdy|dziwaczne przekonanie, -
{39074}{39262}- że W ogóle mogą Wpaść na|oryginalny lub twórczy pomysł.
{39267}{39401}Wszyscy tak sądziliśmy|- W swoim czasie.
{39555}{39705}Panowie, nie przybyliście tu,|aby myśleć samodzielnie.
{39710}{39849}Macie się nauczyć, jak|myśleć za swoich pacjentów.
{39854}{40167}Musicie pamiętać, że|światem rządzą prawa fizyki.
{40172}{40260}Ależ, profesorze...
{40265}{40408}- Co z poglądami filozofów?|- Filozofia?
{40441}{40575}Które mówią o związkach Wyobraźni|oraz intelektu, jak u Paracelsusa.
{40580}{40709}Paracelsus?|Arogancki i głupi Szwajcar.
{40736}{40915}- Albert Wielki?|- Jego bajki obalono 500 lat temu.
{40920}{41069}- Cornelius Agrippa?|- Czarownik. Jak się nazywasz?
{41097}{41230}Wiktor Frankenstein.|Pochodzę z Genewy.
{41258}{41325}Kolejny Szwajcar!
{41345}{41490}Panie Frankenstein, na uniwersytecie|W Ingolstadt -
{41495}{41668}- uczymy sztuki medycznej.|Chemii, biologii, fizyki...
{41673}{41840}- Prawdziwej nauki.|- Na pewno można je połączyć...
{41845}{42024}Nie studiujemy bełkotu|szaleńców i alchemików.
{42029}{42290}Ich fanatyczne dociekania nie|leczą ciała ani nie ratują życia.
{42295}{42407}Jedynie nauka to potrafi.
{42469}{42614}Czy zgadza się pan,|abyśmy kontynuowali?
{42716}{42904}Ładny płaszcz. Nie przejmuj się.|Krempe nie lubi się mylić.
{42909}{43005}- Nie jestem Wariatem!|- Oczywiście, że nie.
{43010}{43170}Tak Właśnie racjonalna osoba|przemawia do nieznajomego!
{43175}{43281}Henry Clerval.|Jestem zupełnym Wariatem.
{43286}{43399}- Wiktor Frankenstein.|- Z Genewy.
{43404}{43535}Uważaj lepiej,|gdzie leziesz.
{43540}{43631}To Schiller.|Ozdoba boiska.
{43636}{43770}Też jest nowy. Gapi się na Wszystko|z otwartą buzią.
{43805}{43891}Dlaczego tu przyjechałeś?
{43896}{44029}- Prowadzić badania.|- Ja tam chcę zostać lekarzem.
{44034}{44196}Szkoda, że dlatego trzeba leczyć|chorych. Strasznie się buntują.
{44201}{44367}Zabawię się, zdobędę dyplom, jeśli|Wreszcie zdam anatomię, -
{44372}{44571}- i Wtedy będę przynosił ulgę starym|damom oraz ich córkom.
{44576}{44724}- Kto to był?|- Waldman.
{44729}{44884}Powiadają. Że W młodości|był prawdziwym geniuszem.
{44889}{45034}Wplątał się niestety W jakieś|nielegalne doświadczenia.
{45039}{45126}Ciekaw jestem,|jakie?
{45131}{45249}Cóż to mówiłeś o bogatych|damach i ich córkach?
{45254}{45379}Życie pełne poświęceń,|ktoś to jednak musi robić.
{45820}{45930}Centralny system nerwowy|oraz mózg -
{45935}{46110}- są najbardziej skomplikowanym|układem, jaki można sobie Wyobrazić.
{46115}{46241}Panie Frankenstein.|Proszę Wykonać cięcie.
{46401}{46571}Wyśmienicie. Panie Clerval,|proszę usunąć pokrywę czaszki.
{46696}{46802}"Henry nadal próbuje|zaliczyć anatomię."
{46808}{46969}- To była dla mnie mordęga.|- Wiele się uczę.
{46974}{47120}"Prof. Waldman jest niezwykły.|Niech Was Bóg błogosławi, Wiktor."
{47125}{47241}- Bardzo pięknie.|- P.S. Zadurzyłem się.
{47246}{47399}"Jest piękną brunetką i zawsze,|gdy mnie Widzi, merda ogonem."
{47404}{47556}"Nazywa się Putzi i jest najbardziej|przyjaznym owczarkiem na świecie."
{47617}{47763}"PS. Elizabeth.|Marzę o twoich lśniących Włosach...
{47768}{47986}{Y:i}... o twych ramionach i piersiach,|i naszej nocy poślubnej. "
{47991}{48134}- Co jeszcze pisze?|- "Ciężko pracuję i poznaję ludzi."
{48139}{48224}Kto ma ochotę na kawę?
{48270}{48469}Zapamiętaj sobie, Frankenstein!|Życie to życie, a śmierć to śmierć.
{48474}{48604}- To są fakty absolutne.|- Nonsens!
{48609}{48734}Wielokrotnie temu przeczono.|Pan również. Sir!
{48739}{48903}Nie Wiemy, gdzie zaczyna się śmierć.|Włosy i paznokcie nadal rosną...
{48907}{49110}Choć mózg umiera, serce|i płuca Wciąż funkcjonują.
{49115}{49330}Ostrzegam cię - to, co mówisz,|jest nielegalne i niemoralne.
{49335}{49414}Bzdura!
{49431}{49616}"Kochany dzienniku, czemu nikt mnie|nie rozumie? PS. Nie jestem szalony."
{49645}{49714}Ty!
{49719}{49877}- Wytłumacz się.|- Pragnę poznać nową naukę.
{49882}{50067}Połączenie Współczesnych dyscyplin|z dawną Wiedzą. Aby stworzyć...
{50072}{50168}Co takiego?
{50173}{50266}Możemy zmienić świat.|Pan to Wie.
{50271}{50404}Dokonalibyśmy epokowych odkryć,|gdybyśmy stawiali Właściwe pytania.
{50409}{50490}Proszę mi pomóc.
{50565}{50629}Chodź.
{50634}{50725}- Wiktor...|- Nie bój się.
{50980}{51056}Henry.
{51436}{51530}Zamknij drzwi.
{51650}{51814}Przez tysiące lat|Chińczycy uważali, że, -
{51819}{51942}- ciało jest chemiczną maszyną.|Poruszaną strumieniami energii.
{51948}{52065}- Fascynujące! Jak?|- Nie dotykaj!
{52104}{52264}Chińscy lekarze Wbijają W ciała|pacjentów podobne igły -
{52269}{52409}- W różne miejsca, aby|kierować przepływem energii.
{52414}{52595}- Elektryczność jest najważniejsza!|- Popatrz na to.
{53026}{53135}Dalej, dotknij.
{53219}{53282}Ciepłe.
{53329}{53408}Jak się masz?
{53455}{53579}- Trzeba to Wyłączyć!|- Nie działa.
{53585}{53746}Musimy zmniejszyć polaryzację.|Ramię małpy Wygląda jak ludzkie.
{53751}{53904}- Żadna ręka nie jest tak silna!|- To się musi udać.
{54049}{54129}Pomogę panu, profesorze.
{54187}{54314}Proszę dochować tajemnicy.
{54319}{54455}I tak nikt by panu nie uwierzył.
{54552}{54710}Najdroższy Wiktorze.|Niewiele się u nas zmieniło.
{54715}{54873}Pani Moritz Wciąż kocha i maltretuje|Justine, jednakowo.
{54878}{55065}Willie jest coraz bardziej dojrzały,|co raduje niezwykle twego ojca.
{55070}{55132}Ja zaś...
{55137}{55339}Bardzo za tobą tęsknię.|Napisz szybko, Wiktorze.
{55353}{55438}Na przykład szczepionki.
{55442}{55637}30 lat temu nikt o nich nie słyszał.|To jednak połowiczna odpowiedź.
{55641}{55798}- Co masz na myśli?|- Tworząc życie, oszukamy śmierć.
{55803}{55941}- Jest tylko jeden Bóg.|- Boga do tego nie mieszaj.
{55946}{56090}Gdyby ktoś tobie bliski miał chore|serce, czy nie dałbyś mu innego?
{56095}{56329}To nie jest niemożliwe. Skoro tak,|można będzie Wymienić każdą część.
{56335}{56491}Możemy stworzyć istotę, która nie|zachoruje, nie umrze. Lepszą. -
{56497}{56582}- mądrzejszą i bardziej cywilizowaną.
{56587}{56692}- Za naszego życia?|- Nie!
{56808}{56954}- Jak blisko pan dotarł?|- Zbyt blisko.
{57022}{57113}- Błagam, by pokazał mi pan notatki.|- Nie.
{57117}{57296}Zajmuję się teraz Wyłącznie|ochroną życia.
{57301}{57429}- Porzuciłem inne eksperymenty.|- Dlaczego?
{57486}{57578}Bo okazały się ohydne.
{58176}{58335}- Nie zarazisz mnie ospą!|- Podają nam zarazki ospy?
{58340}{58590}- To surowica przeciw ospie.|- Powiedziałeś, ospa!
{58595}{58814}Jest nieszkodliwa. Inaczej Wprowadzą|W mieście kwarantannę.
{58819}{58999}- Nie zrobisz mi zastrzyku.|- Zrobię. Takie jest prawo!
{59004}{59175}- Posadźcie go.|- Nie zrobisz mi zastrzyku!
{59264}{59339}Profesorze?
{59492}{59588}Proszę!
{59611}{59727}To nie ma sensu. Umarł.|Zostaw go W spokoju.
{59732}{59862}- Nie powinno do tego dojść!|- Opanuj się.
{59866}{60005}To się nie powinno było stać!
{60246}{60341}Niech Was piekło pochłonie!
{60346}{60513}Mówcie sobie. Co chcecie.|Ale lekarze to mordercy.
{60517}{60652}Zabijacie niewinnych ludzi!|Diabły Wcielone!
{60714}{60880}To Wy zasłużyliście na śmierć.|Bóg Was pokaże.

{62300}{62360}Surowce...
{62938}{63109}- Chodź! Czego się obawiasz?|- Wszystkiego! Jeśli Władze...
{63114}{63255}Będziemy dyskretni.|Mam dzienniki Waldmana.
{63261}{63472}- Ukradłeś je?|- Musimy dokończyć jego dzieło.
{63477}{63679}Gdyby to było możliwe, a ty miałbyś|prawo podjąć taką decyzję, -
{63684}{63774}- czy cena, jaką trzeba zapłacić,|nie byłaby za Wysoka?
{63779}{63992}Moglibyśmy pokonać śmierć i choroby,|ofiarować życie Wszystkim, -
{63998}{64150}- aby ci, którzy się kochają.|Zawsze byli razem...
{64154}{64279}Myślę, że Warto zaryzykować.
{64846}{64949}Justine, daj mi spokój.|Nie chcę o tym rozmawiać.
{64980}{65199}- Listy, które nam czytałaś...|- Ja je napisałam! Od miesięcy...
{65204}{65345}- Elizabeth...|- Dzieje się coś okropnego.
{65350}{65515}Musiałam ukryć to przed ojcem.|A teraz te pogłoski o cholerze.
{65520}{65705}- Dam sobie radę. Jedź!|- Pewno znalazł sobie kogoś innego.
{65710}{65830}Gdyby należał do mnie,|dawno bym już pojechała.
{65835}{66036}Nie jest jednak mój.|Tylko twój, Więc musisz jechać.

{66597}{66706}Tkanki do ponownego Wykorzystania.
{66911}{66971}Najwspanialszy mózg.
{67346}{67479}- Ależ oni zmarli na cholerę, sir.|- To bez znaczenia.
{67700}{67853}Zgromadzone organy trzeba odżywić,|ogrzać, lecz głównie dostarczyć...
{67858}{67999}...energii z zewnątrz.
{68105}{68192}W sposób bardziej bezpośredni...
{68840}{68960}Wody płodowe to główny|biogeniczny element doświadczenia.
{68965}{69077}Igły umieszcza się W|ogniskach energetycznych ciała.
{69082}{69199}Gdy prąd przestaje płynąć,|martwa ropucha nadal się porusza -
{69204}{69325}- niezależnie od|zewnętrznych źródeł energii.
{69588}{69720}Ależ tak.
{69725}{69855}Oto Właściwa kombinacja!

{71880}{71980}Otwieraj!
{71985}{72125}- Czego chcesz?|- W mieście szaleje cholera!
{72130}{72288}Wprowadzono stan Wyjątkowy.|Słuchasz mnie?
{72293}{72429}Wojsko zarządziło kwarantannę.|Trzeba uciekać.
{72448}{72544}A jeśli Krempe doniesie|na ciebie Władzom?
{72549}{72628}Do Widzenia, Henry.
{72633}{72766}Wiktorze, to ja, Elizabeth.
{72836}{72982}Słyszysz mnie?|Muszę cię zobaczyć.
{73036}{73156}- Odejdź.|- Proszę cię, Wiktorze!
{73218}{73351}Nie odejdę, dopóki|mnie nie Wpuścisz.
{73531}{73631}Podejdź do bocznych drzwi.
{73648}{73739}Sama!
{74092}{74204}Co się z tobą dzieje?
{74209}{74310}Jak możesz tak żyć?
{74315}{74438}- I ten smród...|- Nie wchodź tam!
{74563}{74681}- Musimy jechać, naprawdę.|- Ja zostaję.
{74686}{74799}- Nawet, gdybyś miał umrzeć?|- Tak.
{75156}{75346}- Pomogę ci Więc.|- To niemożliwe.
{75443}{75571}Złożyliśmy ślub.
{75701}{75807}Błagam cię.
{75884}{76015}Wiem. Że trudno to|zrozumieć. -
{76020}{76185}- lecz nie mogę porzucić|teraz swojego eksperymentu.
{76190}{76366}Jest zbyt Ważny. Nie tylko dla mnie,|lecz dla całej ludzkości.
{76459}{76605}Muszę dać mu pierwszeństwo.
{76722}{76785}Nawet przed nami?
{76924}{77008}Elizabeth...
{77013}{77134}Bardzo cię kocham, ale...
{77489}{77554}Żegnaj.
{78251}{78330}Elizabeth!
{78439}{78557}Boże drogi! Elizabeth.
{82157}{82231}Ożyj! Ożyj!
{82369}{82451}Tak!
{82931}{83060}Nie...
{83826}{83921}Żyje...
{83951}{84060}Żyje!
{87919}{88022}Co ja uczyniłem?
{88146}{88249}Co ja uczyniłem?
{88581}{88727}Rozległe uszkodzenia...

{89525}{89685}Jutro muszę zniszczyć ten|dziennik i jego tajemnice...
{89714}{89774}...na zawsze.
{90161}{90250}Boże!
{91694}{91745}Nie!
{91750}{91884}Głupcze,|Wiktorze Frankenstein z Genewy!
{91889}{91994}Skąd mogłeś Wiedzieć, co|Wyzwoliłeś?
{91999}{92165}Z czego on powstał?|Z ciał złodziei i morderców...
{92170}{92278}Zło zszyte ze złem,|ozdobione złem...
{92283}{92444}Naprawdę myślisz, że to stworzenie|podziękuje ci za cud narodzin?
{92449}{92556}Zło się jeszcze zemści.
{92570}{92687}Niech Bóg chroni twoich bliskich!
{94943}{95055}Co ty sobie Wyobrażasz?
{95060}{95216}Jest chory!|To on roznosi zarazę!

{96628}{96754}- Nie podchodźcie za blisko.|- Zabijcie go!
{97240}{97342}Tędy pobiegł.
{98751}{98890}Proszę. Spokojnie.|Odrobinę.
{98930}{99100}- Dobrze. Odpoczywaj.|- To ty, Henry...
{99105}{99252}Naturalnie.|Naprawdę niewiele brakowało.
{99257}{99394}Obawiałem się, że to cholera,|ale to tylko zapalenie płuc.
{99399}{99544}Zamieniam się W medyka.|Nawet Krempe jest zadowolony.
{99549}{99645}W takim tempie, mógłbym|chyba zaliczyć anatomię.
{99650}{99839}- Co z epidemią?|- Nic nie da się zrobić.
{99844}{100032}Głodni. Bezdomni i|noworodki z pewnością poumierają.
{100037}{100136}- Tak sądzisz?|- Niestety tak.
{100174}{100338}- Dzięki Bogu.|- Co masz na myśli?
{100546}{100608}Nic.
{100711}{100846}Dobrze Więc,|koniec mojej Warty.

{103448}{103595}- Proszę, Wybacz mi!|- Już ci Wybaczyłam.
{103686}{103883}Nie Wiem, nad czym pracujesz,|ale to cię omal nie zabiło.
{103920}{104046}Skończone.|Nigdy nie powinienem był zaczynać.
{104051}{104160}Nie żyje!
{105804}{105949}Felix!|Nie zapomnij o łupinach.
{105954}{106060}Nie zapomnę.
{106066}{106163}Z drogi!
{106243}{106346}Dalej!
{106766}{106906}- Jak się miewają świnie?|- Są szczęśliwe, dostały jeść.
{106910}{107066}- Co z twoimi rękami?|- Znowu krwawią.
{107268}{107375}Już lepiej.
{107474}{107549}Proszę.

{154806}{154986}Raczej przypomniałem je sobie|niż się ich nauczyłem.
{155025}{155137}Może to ślady pamięciowe|W mózgu.
{155176}{155362}Czy zastanawiałeś się nad|konsekwencjami swoich czynów?

{157134}{157230}Nie Wiesz, o co prosisz.
{157235}{157482}Wiem jednak, że za sympatię|jednej żyjącej istoty -
{157487}{157636}- pogodziłbym się ze światem.

{158630}{158827}Gdzie byście zamieszkali?
{158920}{159149}Powędrowalibyśmy na Północ,|aż do samego bieguna.
{159155}{159284}Do dziewiczej krainy.

{160990}{161089}Musisz Wyjawić prawdę!
{161094}{161249}Tylko miesiąc. Potem się pobierzemy|i zapomnimy o Wszystkim.
{161254}{161354}- Obiecuję.|- Czyżby?!
{161359}{161515}Obiecałeś, że powiesz, kto to jest.|Że skończysz z eksperymentami.

{197553}{197665}- Nie zbliżaj się.|- Wymówiła moje imię!
{197670}{197771}Należy do mnie!
{199329}{199545}Wszystko, co kiedyś kochałem,|umarło - i to z mojej Winy.
{199653}{199776}Podążałem za nim jak cień.
{199781}{199937}Cały czas na Północ.
{199942}{200042}Tyle miesięcy...
{200047}{200137}Opętany jedną myślą:
{200164}{200272}Zabić go.
{200319}{200395}Teraz jednak...
{200516}{200621}...jestem zmęczony.
{200697}{200898}Przeraźliwie zmęczony.
{201370}{201470}Co panu powiedział?
{201476}{201588}Nie żyje.
{201593}{201759}Przed śmiercią bełkotał coś|o jakimś upiorze.
{201764}{201832}Co tam jest, kapitanie?
{201957}{202096}Opowiedział mi historię...
{202155}{202267}...która nie może być prawdziwa.
{202272}{202421}Sądzę, że był szalony.
{202521}{202599}Ciepły Wiatr!
{202668}{202826}- Lody Wreszcie puszczą.|- I co potem, kapitanie?
{203023}{203130}- Popłyniemy na Północ.|- Nie!
{203812}{203882}Kim jesteś?
{203986}{204074}Nie dał mi imienia.
{204908}{205126}- Dlaczego płaczesz?|- Był moim ojcem.
{205194}{205386}"I postanowiłem sobie poznać mądrość|i Wiedzę, szaleństwo i głupotę, -
{205390}{205587}- poznałem, że również i to jest|pogonią za Wiatrem.
{205592}{205715}Bo W Wielkiej mądrości, -
{205721}{205871}- Wiele utrapienia; a kto przysparza|Wiedzy, przysparza i cierpień. "
{205877}{206087}"Bóg bowiem każdą sprawę zawezwie na|sąd; Wszystko, choć ukryte, -
{206092}{206232}- czy dobre było,|czy złe. "
{206483}{206601}- Kapitanie...|- Ma prawo być tu obecny.
{206936}{207038}Chryste, lód pęka!
{207321}{207406}Wracajmy na statek, kapitanie.
{207411}{207488}Zostaw tę przeklętą pochodnię!
{207579}{207673}Chodź z nami.
{207679}{207780}Skończyłem już porachunki z ludźmi.
{208165}{208260}Ratunku!
{208373}{208451}Kapitanie!
{210583}{210716}Dokąd teraz, kapitanie?
{211023}{211132}Do domu.
